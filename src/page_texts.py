            This tool is designed to generate vulnerability reports for digital infrastructure tools, 
            acting as a preventive measure rather than tracking cyberattacks. It offers a quick, 
            initial scan for organizations with a digital infrastructure plan but no primary vulnerability scanner yet. 
            While useful, it doesnâ€™t replace a full cybersecurity solution. Learn more about the project.

            OSV is built on feedback from city cybersecurity workers who face the challenges of small teams, 
            tight budgets, reactive measures and procurement rules that favour propriety softwares. 
            It provides up-to-date and real-time vulnerability insights, making it a valuable resource for municipal 
            governments, NGOs and anyone working in cybersecurity who values and supports open-source softwares.

        **What is cybersecurity?** Cybersecurity involves technologies and procedures designed to protect digital assets. 
        Without strong measures, organizations and individual risk data breaches, financial loss, reputational harm and 
        operational disruptions from malicious attacks.
        **What are cyberattacks?** A cyber threat refers to malicious actions aimed at damaging, stealing or disrupting data, 
        essential systems, and overall digital operations.
        **How can I learn more?** Please access our FAQ page for more complete information on the project and the development 
        of the software. You can also access the Edgelands Institute website to learn more about the research and team behind it.

            The OSV Scanner is a simple online tool that helps identify vulnerabilities in documents like Policy Papers, 
            contracts, and IT plans. Linked to the US National Vulnerability Database, it scans PDF documents to flag 
            potential risks. Open-source and non-intrusive, the OSV Scanner does not require system access, 
            is easy to deploy and does not collect user data. Upload your PDF to get started.
